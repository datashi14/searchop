# Active Context

## Current Focus
Building the data generation and feature engineering pipeline as the foundation for the AI ranking system.

## Recent Changes
- Project initialized from scratch
- Setting up project structure and data generation components

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create project structure
2. 🔄 Generate synthetic data (catalog + clickstream)
3. ⏳ Build feature engineering pipeline
4. ⏳ Train initial model
5. ⏳ Deploy FastAPI service
6. ⏳ Set up Kubernetes infrastructure
7. ⏳ Create Dagster pipeline
8. ⏳ Configure CI/CD

## Active Decisions
- Using Dagster over Airflow for better DX
- Synthetic data generation for reproducibility
- Feature store in Parquet format for efficiency
- Model versioning with simple file-based registry

## Important Patterns
- Color scheme: #73AD6D as primary color
- Verify each component before moving to next step
